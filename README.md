# MSDS451_Assignment2
Portfolio Optimization using Monte Carlo and Stochastic Programming

This project explores portfolio allocation across three assets using Monte Carlo simulation, constrained quadratic optimization, and stochastic programming. The goal is to determine optimal long/short strategies to maximize return given risk tolerance.

## Contents

- `MSDS451_Assignment2.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, analysis, and plots
- `MSDS451_Assignment2.html`: HTML export of the notebook
- `MSDS451_Assignment2_Report.pdf`: Final research report (LaTeX-formatted)

## Summary of Strategies

| Strategy              | Expected Return | Risk (Std. Dev.) |
|-----------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Equal Weight          | ~9.75%          | ~0.0212          |
| Optimized (Quadratic) | ~11.19%         | ~0.0409          |
| Stochastic            | ~11.19%         | ~0.0409          |

## How to Run

1. Open `MSDS451_Assignment2.ipynb` in Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) or a local Jupyter environment
2. Run all cells sequentially from top to bottom
3. Outputs (tables and plots) will be generated inline

No external datasets are requiredâ€”the notebook simulates asset returns
